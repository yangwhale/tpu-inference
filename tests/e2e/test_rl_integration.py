# This file contains end-to-end RL integration tests.
#
# RL (Reinforcement Learning) workloads exercise several features that are
# critical for training-inference pipelines:
#
# Correctness tests verify that:
#   1. Delete + reinitialize HBM KV cache: the engine can free its KV cache,
#      then reallocate it and resume serving with correct outputs.
#   2. Delete KV cache actually reclaims HBM (critical for weight-sync).
#   3. Returning log-probs does not trigger recompilation.
#
# Performance tests verify that:
#   1. Returning log-probs does not add significant latency overhead.
#   2. Group sampling (same prompt, n=16 outputs) benefits from prefix
#      caching.
